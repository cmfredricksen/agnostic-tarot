Aside from practice the best way to learn anything is by taking notes. Writing notes requires thought, even for simple lists. It engages your brain directly as that information goes from it's source through you to the page. The goal in taking notes for your own learning is to use the act of thinking and writing to help information stick.

## Some Tips

1. Always keep pen and paper nearby for jotting down quick notes. 
2. Write down just what is needed, keeping it short.
3. Write down any questions that come to mind so you can research them later.
4. Don't worry about referencing them in the future. If there are notes you want to reference, then you can make another set of in-depth reference notes. I have notes like this! But most of my notes are the quick jot downs that help me remember and learn.
5. If you feel led to draw on your notes, go ahead! Even if it is doodles. It can heighten your intuition to doodle in your notes.
6. Try and use the note taking as a present activity and don't focus on the results. Don't start trying to edit your notes before you have the first sentence done! haha.
7. Jot the date somewhere in your notes just for future interest.

## Reference Notes

Once you have taken some notes you may want to consolidate parts into a reference source for yourself. I have done this with different topics over the years.

You can get a notebook of some kind and assign it as your reference. Then you can plan a little bit and enter the data into your notebook for easy retrieval in the future. You can get a lot of the information from your temporary notes!

You can add images and other hand drawn elements to your notebook too.

I highly recommend both passing notes and reference notes. They each have their own use and are a great way to learn more and retain knowledge, of any topic.
