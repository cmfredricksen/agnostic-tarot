The suits are a way to begin building your reading upon the foundation of keywords. They give additional information and context that can lead to deep insight.

I am using the suits differently than what I have been taught. Mainly to get away from magical associations, but also to bring the meanings of the cards down to Earth. For example, I am using batons rather than wands. A baton is is a tool you can use whereas a wand makes me think of magic.

The meanings I have listed below are what I take from the suits, they are not _"right"_ or definitive answers. They are jumping off points, and the meanings can change at any time depending on surrounding cards and your intuition. I think in general the suit should come secondary to the rank of the card.

In most systems the suits are given elemental assignments but I am going to skip that too. I think that is a topic for later once you are comfortable with reading. Once you have reading in hand there will be a lifetime of learning waiting for you if you want it!
