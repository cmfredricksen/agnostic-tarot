The suits are a way to begin building your reading upon the foundation of keywords. They give additional information and context that can lead to deep insight.

I am using the suits differently than what I have been taught. Mainly to get away from magical associations, but also to bring the meanings of the cards down to Earth. For example, I am using batons rather than wands. A baton is is a tool you can use whereas a wand makes me think of magic.

The meanings I have listed below are what I take from the suits, they are not _"right"_ or definitive answers. They are jumping off points, and the meanings can change at any time depending on surrounding cards and your intuition. I think in general the suit should come secondary to the rank of the card.

In most systems the suits are given elemental assignments but I am going to skip that too. I think that is a topic for later once you are comfortable with reading. Once you have reading in hand there will be a lifetime of learning waiting for you if you want it!

## Batons 
 I have assigned the suit of batons to the physical body and physical energy levels. They can also signify structures or actual batons.

## Swords
Swords point to thoughts, the mind, and communication. They can also signify actually using a knife, or cutting something.

## Cups
Cups embody emotions and feelings. They can also refer to food, drink and water in general.

## Coins
Coins are material resources including money, property, and other tangible items. The suit can also refer to work, job, schooling, or career.

## Suits Chart

Each suit has it's basic meaning, playing card association, and some other basic qualities typically linked to them. You can use them to add more context and depth to your readings.

## Next step:

Go through your pips, three at a time and call them out by trait and read them through that lens. There is no right or wrong, this is just for fun. For example:

Also add an image file to copy, gitignore.
