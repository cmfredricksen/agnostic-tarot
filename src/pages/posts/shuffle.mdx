Tarot cards can be a challenge to shuffle due to the size and print quality of the deck. There are several decks made with paper that is not meant to be riffle shuffled. Here are some ways to randomize, or mix, your deck. This list is in order of most thorough shuffle to least.

## Riffle Shuffle

Your basic playing card shuffle is the quickest and most efficient way to mix the cards. It also causes more wear and tear on the cards, so I wouldn't use this method for any decks that aren't printed on playing card stock.

## Card Over Card

Randomizing the cards by holding the deck cradled in one hand and with the other hand removing some from the back and then dropping them in front, reordering as you go.

## On the Table

You can lay the cards face down on the table and mix them around and then pick random cards from the pile for your reading.

## Making Card Heaps

Go through the deck and lay the cards into 5 piles, one at a time. Start by making a row of five and then after that place the remaining cards into the piles in random order, until you are through the deck. Then you can combine the heaps in random order. This takes a little more time, but it is thorough.

## Auto Mix With Pickup

Whenever I am done with a reading and I am picking up the cards I always put each card in the deck separately. I pick up a card and either just slip it into the middle of the deck somewhere or put it on the top or bottom and give it a shuffle. 

## What I do

I use all of these methods in different combinations. I use the hand over hand most often with the others filling in the gaps. I always mix my cards back in as I pick them up and then I shuffle them hand over hand before I proceed. I don't riffle too often, not even with playing cards.

If you keep drawing the same card(s) over and over again, or the readings just aren't making sense:
