## Note:
These meanings are possible meanings, they are not right or wrong. Every meaning is dependent on the context of the reading. What the card symbolizes in the reading will influence it's interpretation. 

For each note, you could get out the cards and look at them and see if you agree. Do you see anything else that supports the idea listed? There are no wrong answers, just strengthening of knowledge and intuition!

- The Moon and the Sun could signify introverted and extroverted personalities. The Moon type might be more quiet, passive, solitary and introspective while the Sun type might be more assertive, social and outspoken.

- The Lovers signifies a choice and the angel pointing the arrow at the left shoulder while the young man is looking the other way tells me that this choice will have unforseen consequences.
