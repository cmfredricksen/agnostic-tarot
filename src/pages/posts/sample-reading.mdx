import { Image } from "astro:assets" ;

import twoCoins from "../../images/cbd_tarot/d02.jpg";
import valetBatons from "../../images/cbd_tarot/b11.jpg";
import sevenCups from "../../images/cbd_tarot/c07.jpg";
import aceSwords from "../../images/cbd_tarot/e01.jpg";
import fiveCoins from "../../images/cbd_tarot/d05.jpg";
import eightSwords from "../../images/cbd_tarot/e08.jpg";

Here are a couple of examples, feel free to modify the methods or keywords as needed. For instructions please visit [The Agnostic Method](/posts/the-agnostic-method).

<div class="card-row">
    <img src={twoCoins.src} alt="Two of Coins" title="Two of Coins"/>
    <img src={valetBatons.src} alt="Valet of Batons" title="Valet of Batons"/>
    <img src={sevenCups.src} alt="Seven of Cups" title="Seven of Cups"/>
</div>

First I will write dow the keywords from my [keyword list](/posts/keywords):

a.choice
b.seek 
c.experience

There is a choice to seek experience. 

Going further based on the picture, the querant (valet of batons) is deciding if they should take this new job that offers good and varied experiences. 

You could go even deeper, there is more information to draw from the cards and you can also consider their position in the spread, and then correspondences. 

Once you have had some practice, you can switch it up if you want. You can also use this method to get started on a reading when you are drawing a blank. Just start with the keyword and build from there.

One More Example:

<div class="card-row">
    <img src={aceSwords.src} alt="Ace of Swords" title="Ace of Swords"/>
    <img src={fiveCoins.src} alt="Five of Coins" title="Five of Coins"/>
    <img src={eightSwords.src} alt="Eight of Swords" title="Eight of Swords"/>
</div>

Keywords:

a. new
b. change
c. forward

A new idea to change momentum.

Going further based on the picture I would say that some type of new financial / career challenge is coming your way, but you are solid and ready for it. Keep doing what you are doing.

#### Note about examples

These are just free associations. If I was actually reading for myself or another person I would probably have different results based on the querant's own life and energy. **Context is key!!**

Another thing to note is that the meanings are mundane. There is no cosmic force at play in Agnostic Tarot, it is just rote practice.
