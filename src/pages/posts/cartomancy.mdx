Playing cards are a great addition to your readings. You can use them for yes/no questions, for quick practical answers, to clarify tarot cards or even for in depth readings. They are cheap and easy to find. You can write keywords on them if you want for practice.

There are several different systems and meanings for playing cards, and people seem more rigid about what the cards signify, so please proceed as you feel led to. 

You can use the keywords from Agnostic Tarot for the number cards and use the valet, queen and king keywords for the Jack, Queen and King. The Jack could fill in for either the Valet or the Knight, so be open to that possibility.

| Twos    | Choice     |       Pair, balance                             |

| Queens  | Patience   |    Also:  Woman, Nurturer, Manager                               |
| Kings   | Knowledge  |      Also: Man, Logical,  Leader                             |

Just like keywords for tarot, these keywords are just a starting point. They are one of a myriad of possible meanings for each card. I suggest getting a practice deck of playing cards and writing meanings on them, then you can practice reading them.
