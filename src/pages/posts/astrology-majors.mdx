 Here are some basic correspondances for the major arcana that are pretty universal in Western tarot methods. Use what resonates and take your time. There is a lot to unpack. You can get your majors in order and then go through each card as you look at the associations. Some of them will stick.

 There are 4 elements: Fire, Water, Air and Earth

 The Astro Column includes the planets(7), the astrological signs(12), and the 4 elements(4). Card 21, The World, can be used for both the planet Saturn and the element of Earth. You can group them by element, or by planets, or by astrological associations for some interesting combinations.

 I am grouping the cards in sevens, with the Fool remaining free.

 - I - VII
 - VIII - XIV
 - XV - XXI
 - The Fool

 You can seperate your majors from the deck and lay them out in 3 rows of seven and see if you notice anything of interest.

 You can group cards together for further insights. For example every card that ends in one(1), the Juggler, Fortitude and The World, put them together and see if you notice anything that ties them together. You could go further and include The Wheel of Fortune _(10) 1 + 0 = 1_, The Sun _(19) 1 + 9 = 10_ All aces, and all tens.

 Another thing you can do is to add up the numbers for cards over 10 and then read that major. For example if you draw Temperance (14), also pull card (5) The Pope, because 1 + 4 = 5. You can do this with minors too, incorporating numerology.

**Additional Note:**

 Valet = 11 / 2 
 
 Knight = 12 / 3
 
 Queen = 13 / 4 
 
 King = 14 / 5
