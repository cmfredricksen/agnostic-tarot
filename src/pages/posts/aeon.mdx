All I see when I look around is futile grasping and clinging to power that is fast slipping away. All of our idols are crashing down around us, and we feel the air of freedom stirring within us.

Who is the authority that stands to lead us? Someone who isn't even qualified and doesn't even care about the outcome of his choices? The gods of today are a farce, unserious and lacking intelligence. They are there because they climbed to the top of these old structures using their money and their connections.

They are not able to do the job, but they can't understand that because they are ignorant. They do not care about the results, they have forgotten them within the hour. They will not stand, no matter how much they believe they will.

The reality is that there is no authority except what we accept. 

Maybe these things are living on borrowed time, or should I say stolen time? That is why they feel heavy and overbearing. At the Equinox of the Gods things are crashing. The ground is shaking. The rocks are breaking. As it all comes down, never to rise again.

A great man showed me this truth, and he was gifted with words - but he got some things wrong. And in spite of sharing the great equinox, he was full of hubris and short on empathy. He thought he was smarter than he was. And he WAS very intelligent.

He was a product of the old age, yet he caught a glimpse of the next age dawning during his time here. Just the very soft lightening of the sky before daybreak - which allowed him to see the coming day.
