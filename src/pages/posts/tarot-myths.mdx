There are several so called rules about tarot and reading cards. They seem to be a form of gatekeeping, meant to discourage new comers from learning how to read. 

### Myth 1 <span class="emphasis">You must be gifted your first tarot deck</span>

This is myth number one because it stops you from even getting a deck! You can never use tarot, or learn how to read, if you don't have a deck! It is also widely believed for some reason. We are talking about a deck of cards, mass printed in most cases and available at your local bookstore. 

If you have to wait to be given a deck by someone you might never get a deck. It makes card reading seem exclusive, some person has chosen you to receive a deck. That being said, I do gift people decks. I love tarot so much, I like to share the joy and usefulness with others.

The truth is you can buy yourself a deck and check it out. There is no harm done, it is all good. If you get into it you will probably buy other decks too. Buying a deck does not make you a reader, some people are collectors and do not care about reading the cards. That is understandable because each deck is a work of art and some decks are also modern replicas of historical decks dating back to the 15th century.

So if you are interested in checking out tarot, then please buy yourself a deck.

### Myth 2 <span class="emphasis">You have to be psychic to read the tarot</span>

This is another rule that stops you before you even start, plus it is really vague. What does it mean to be psychic in this instance? The world of psychic abilities is very large. 

You do not need psychic abilities or any beliefs to read tarot. You can read the cards using the little white book that came with your deck! Sure, it will probably not be really deep or nuanced but you can do it. You can read using your intuition and your own reactions to the images and get excellent results.

The more you read, the more your intuition will develop. Tarot is a tool and you have to use it to master it. I think of it like painting, learning how to use the brushes.
