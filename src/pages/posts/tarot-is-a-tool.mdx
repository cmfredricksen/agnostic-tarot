Reading tarot is like making art. The tools are different but the end result is very similar.

I am an artist, in that I make art on the regular, and I liken my tarot deck to my paint brushes. They are specialized for my medium, so a decent investment of money, and I love them. I take care of them, and replace them when they wear out. But if I am not happy with the results of my painting, or feeling down and defeated, it never occurs to me that the brushes are somehow behind it.

I never think my brushes are judging me even though I am imagining the judgement of other people and judging myself. I do not think that any magick or spirits are attached to my brushes. I do not think that future paintings are waiting to be manifested from my brushes. They are not sacred to me. They are tools and they assist me in manifesting my creativity.

Without me, my brushes are completely inert. What I make with the brushes comes from me. It is from my mind and my imagination. My art is an expression of my ideas and my emotions, influenced by my skill. I feel the same way about tarot cards. But I admit, it is challenging sometimes. I have to make the effort to remember this when I am feeling stressed and anxious.

Because of how well tarot works at triggering creative thinking, it feels like magic! It can seem like the cards are telling you things or revealing the unknown, or even like they are judging you when you draw cards that feel bad! But it is all in the reader. The random images allow the reader to tap into their intuition, bringing together logic and imagination to find new answers, in my opinion. But it definitely feels like magic at times.

As a matter of fact, I think that if you have anxiety or negative thinking patterns, if you are feeling low in any way, don't read tarot. You should use Oracle cards with uplifting imagery and messages. You could also remove any cards from your tarot deck that cause you distress and use the deck without them. This is a perfectly valid option and a form of self care. I have used oracle cards exclusively at times and also have taken breaks from reading as needed.
