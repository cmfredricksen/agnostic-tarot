### Can I buy my own Deck
Yes, you can buy your own deck. You can buy as many decks as you want. Some people collect decks and have huge inventories of tarot, oracle and playing cards. You will probably change decks and or add different decks to your rotation over time. Decks will come and go, and that is ok! Life is always changing and your interests will shift. Not to mention, there are so many beautiful and interesting decks to choose from! And each one has it's own nuance.

Tarot decks are tools for thinking. They are similar to paint brushes, I love my watercolor brushes but they are getting worn down and ragged. I cannot make the smooth line I used to without great effort. So now I will upgrade my brush and retire my old one. My new brush could be better too, as quality has gone up.

My old brush doesn't care. I do feel sentimental towards it, but I want to paint! So I try not to get too hung up on the tool, as lovely as it is! 

So if you get a deck and you don't resonate with it, move on to another. If you see a new release coming up and you want to check it out, go ahead and get it. Different decks can take on different seasons, reasons, and feelings. It is a lot easier to find your deck yourself than to wait for some hypothetical stranger to gift you a deck. Unless you hang out with readers, that increases your chances but by no means guarantees any gifted decks coming your way.

### Can tarot predict the future?
This is a loaded question with a lot of complexity. To start, what do you mean by "predict the future"? A tarot reading is more like a weather forecast than a prophecy. With tarot and your own experience you can get a strong sense of where you are and where you are heading, short term. The further out, the less sure the forecast is. (Just like the weather!)

Tarot has no control over life, or other people, or you! Tarot can help you see where you are heading and give you some concrete steps to attain your goals, or avoid a negative outcome.

### Should I use reversals in my readings?
It is up to you if you want to use reversals or not. They are not necessary, you will get all of the information you need in a deck of tarot cards only reading upright. That being said, an upsidedown card can be pointing something out. In the context of the reading it could be valuable.

For beginners, I think you should wait until you know the upright meanings pretty well. But if you draw a reversed card in a reading, you should pause for a moment and reflect on the card. How is it interacting with the cards around them. Is there something to this? You might be surprised at what comes to mind.

If the cards you draw are reversed simply turn them upright and proceed. If a lot them are reversed you might want to [reorder the deck](/posts/reorder-deck).
