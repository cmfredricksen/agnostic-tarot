There is nothing to fear in the tarot cards, or playing cards for that matter. They were created as games, and games were frowned on for the commoners about 600 years ago. The authority back then was the church, and religious authority, and they especially hated fun. They associated anything they didn't like as sin and from the devil.

There is a lot of mythology about tarot that goes back to fairly recently (_less than 200 years!_) in the scheme of things. A lot of the origin stories were completely imagined and made up by early occultists. It is all very interesting, and I think that it is worth studying if you want to. But, you don't have to at all. 

And you don't have to obey their rules, use their meanings, or believe their mythologies. You can read the tarot based on the images alone if you want. BUT, using the associations is a shortcut to developing your own understanding of the tarot. Just like keywords are a jumping off point, a base to build on - so are the various cartomantic systems and meanings.

Personally, I do use some of those systems and meanings. They give me a structure that makes sense to me and I build from there. Yet I don't feel chained to any of them, I listen to my own intuition and the context of the reading above all else. Esoteric knowledge is in addition to, it is not needed. You can read the cards just using the images and your own intuition.

So don't let fear stand in your way. You can read the cards, and reading the cards is how you learn how to do it. Start simple and have fun. 

Cartomancy is an ongoing affair, a living language that is shaped by the interaction between the reader, the cards, and their own intuition. Each reading shapes the meaning of the cards as the context changes.
