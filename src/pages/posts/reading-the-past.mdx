 ## Daily / Weekly Review

 I am a fan of using the tarot to look back on my day, or week and seeing what stands out. I will draw 1-3 cards in the morning and look at them briefly. I will leave them out on the table or somewhere I will see them at the end of the day. Sometimes I don't get back to them for a few days. This is a very laid back practice.

 Then I come back to them and I think over my day, or week, while looking st the card(s) and see if anything resonates. If nothing stands out, that is ok. I can draw another card or two for clarity if I want to.

 There is less pressure as I am not trying to forecast anything, though I might see something connecting or in process. You should approach this exercise lightly and you will learn more about the tarot.

 ## Revisiting Past Events

 You can use tarot to revisit a past event and get more insight into what may have happened. Choose an event that is not too close or sensitive, maybe even skip anything personal. Use your best judgement, the goal is to get practice reading and encourage yourself.

 For example I did a reading on an ancestor who died tragically at the age of 21 years old, about 50 years before I was born. I laid out an astro spread of 3 rows of 4 cards each and allowed the cards to tell a story. I tried to make sense of what happened to him and how that affected the family tree. as I looked at the cards, I saw patterns and groupings that spoke to me.

 I made some [passing notes](/posts/passing-notes) on the reading, and had some interesting insights about the cards. The thing about tarot is that even after 3 decades of reading I still learn something new everytime I read the cards!

 Now, I will never make the case that I got facts, or that I was channeling spirits during this reading. He died over 100 years ago and there is little remaining information I have found. But I did spend time thinking of him, the circumstances of his life back then, and the impact this death might have had on the survivors. 

 But I also got a chance to see the cards in new contexts, and had my intuition ignited. I got some additional practice without much stress because it was an exercise for my own edification, there are no right or wrong answers.

 You could also read on a historical event or person. Treat it as a game.
