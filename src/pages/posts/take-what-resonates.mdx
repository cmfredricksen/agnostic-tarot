Learning to trust your intuition makes it stronger and that in turn makes you trust it more. This is the growth of your intuition, and in time I came to trust my own intuition more than any other person. _Disclaimer: I still trust other people, especially experts. I am talking about my take on personal issues in my life. I can trust my gut and my intuition tells me what is going on._  

Whenever you read the cards you should only take what resonates with you from the reading. It is ok to take what you need in the moment and leave the rest. 

## What Resonates?

Some clues that your intuition is nudging you:

<ul class="content-list">
- &#9884; Words, phrases, or ideas spring into your mind. This includes thoughts about people, places and anything else that pops into your head out of the blue.
- &#9884; Strong feelings washing over you. Pay attention to those feelings and try to figure out where they came from.
- &#9884; Visual details stand out. For example a certain number or color really speaks to you directly.
</ul>

## Trust Your intuition

By taking what resonates and trusting your intution you are strengthening your card reading abilities. It also rubs off in other parts of your life, allowing you to see what is most important and cutting out the distractions. With practice you will be able to recognize your intuition more easily and trust what it is telling you, to your benefit.
