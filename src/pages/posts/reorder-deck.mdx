Usually it is because my readings are off, or I am feeling confused by the cards being drawn. It just isn't making sense!"

I am going to advocate for this minor, slightly woo practice. 

Sometimes my readings get stale or I get blocked. I might start drawing the same card(s) over and over again.

So what I do is reorder my deck. First I seperate them into 5 piles:
<ul class="rt-margin">
- Batons
- Cups
- Swords
- Coins
- Major Arcana
</ul>

Then I reorder each group, followed by putting all 5 groups in order. Then it is done!

The next time you use the cards shuffle them more thoroughly than normal. They will be refreshed, or it will seem like they are!
