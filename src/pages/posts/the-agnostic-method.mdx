The agnostic method for card reading is a way to memorize the keywords and practice reading cards through repetition, not relying on anything deep or elaborate. What you need:
<ul class="rt-margin">
- A Tarot de Marseille deck  [#Buying a Deck](/posts/buying-a-deck)
- Paper and pen
- Keywords [#Keyword Chart](/posts/keywords)
</ul>

### The Agnostic Method for reading Tarot
_note: These readings are anonymous, they are not for a certain person or about a certain topic. You are free associating. But don't be surprised when you notice some of the cards do pertain to you!_

<ol class="rt-margin">
1. Shuffle the cards
2. Draw three cards and lay them in a row.
3. Write down the keyword for each card _(only the keyword, not the rank/suit or title of the card)_
4. Build a story based on those words and the illustrations on the cards and write it down, it should be a short sentence at most.
5. Repeat 3 - 10 times
</ol>


You should not spend much time on these, as soon as the ideas dry up move on to the next one. There is no right or wrong. Some cards may leave you with a blank, just move on. 

The positions of the cards do not matter unless something sticks out to you. We will expand on the three card readings later, for now we just want to focus on learning the keywords and seeing how the cards interact with each other.

This should be approached in a casual / fun manner. You are just playing and experimenting with the cards. Sometimes I just shuffle the cards and go through the cards three at a time until I am ready to stop. I learn so much about the cards and their little details by looking at them in different contexts.

See my [Agnostic Method Sample Reading](/posts/sample-reading) to see some examples.

Once you become comfortable handling your deck and have memorized the keywords of the pips you can move on to some of the [exercises](/tags/exercises) I use to study the cards. I will add more in the future.
