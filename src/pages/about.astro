      Agnostic tarot is for everyone. Tarot works, it is an effective tool for
      creative thinking. There are many theories and superstitions about card
      reading and how it works.

      I believe that the randomness and the images and the colors trigger our
      minds. There is no magic required. No gods, no angels, no rituals, no
      rules. To be clear, these things can enhance the experience - but are not
      required.

      There is no authority in tarot. There is the wisdom gained by those who
      have gone before, and it holds great value. But as experience is gained,
      and knowledge grows, cards will begin to hold their own nuanced meanings
      for you.
