<BaseHTML title="About Agnostic Tarot">
  <p>
    Agnostic tarot is for everyone. Tarot works, it is an effective tool for
    creative thinking. There are many theories and superstitions about card
    reading and how it works.

    I believe that the randomness and the images and the colors trigger our
    minds. There is no magic required. No gods, no angels, no rituals, no rules.
    To be clear, these things can enhance the experience - but are not required.

    There is no authority in tarot. There is the wisdom gained by those who have
    gone before, and it holds great value. But as experience is gained, and
    knowledge grows, cards will begin to hold their own nuanced meanings for
    you.
