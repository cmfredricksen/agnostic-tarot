  <h2>About Agnostic Tarot</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to Agnostic Tarot, the cartomancy learning system created by C.M.
    Fredricksen. Agnostic Tarot empowers the reader with down to earth reading
    exercises and simple meanings while avoiding complex <em>meta</em> card definitions.
  </p>
  <p>
    We know tarot works, but no one can be sure exactly <span
      style="font-style: italic;">how</span
    > it works. The good news is that you don't have to know how it works to do tarot
    readings. Using Agnostic Tarot, you can start practicing card reading right away.
    Once you have the basics down, you can follow your interests and deepen your understanding
    of cartomancy.

    My purpose for creating Agnostic Tarot is to offer tarot as a tool to people
    who might be deterred by gatekeeping and myths surrounding cartomancy.
    Agnostic tarot is for practical use and enjoyment.
  </p>
  <strong>
    There are no spirits, energies, magic, psychology, or anything else complex
    connected to Agnostic Tarot.
  </strong>

    Cartomancy is said to be for entertainment purposes only. I would add that
    it is also for enrichment and creative problem solving. But the point is,
    you are always in control with tarot. If a reading doesn't resonate, leave
    it. Take what is useful for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    As you practice reading your intuition will grow stronger, along with your
    awareness. Cartomancy is also really interesting with endless avenues of
    study and collection.
